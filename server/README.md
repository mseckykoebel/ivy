# ðŸ’¾ Ivy/api

Ivy's API has two major pieces of functionality:

1. Serve as the proxy server to Ivy/client to NUs course API
2. Opinionated proxy layer/data cleaning layer over the course API

## Ivy/client's proxy server

- Plug and play support for Ivy's client application. Close nit URLs. Secure access from both development and production. CORS-supported
- 1:1 typings (v1.1) with Ivy's client application
- Null checking and custom error handling that Ivy/client is aware of natively

## Opinionated data layer over NUs course API

- Returns opinionated, Ivy-typed JSON bundles from NUs course API.
- Light data cleaning of NUs course API information
